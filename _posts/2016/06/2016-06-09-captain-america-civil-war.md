One of the most worrisome aspects of the carnage-loving swarm of modern blockbusters is the blissful disregard for any semblance of real-world consequence to the protagonists&apos; slugging matches.
*The Avengers* was such a blast because the citywide scale of the final act gave a sense of increased scale to the conflict, but, after the diminishing returns epitomised by *Age of Ultron*, you start to crave some kind of accountability.
Swooping in like a perfectly chiselled emblem of American values, Zach Snyder came to address that issue with this year&apos;s major superhero battle royale.

Only, we all know he didn&apos;t.
*Batman V Superman* was all sorts of things, but a serious and measured consideration of the human toll that these carnival rides of cartoon violence overlook is not one of them.
Snyder paid lip service to the notion of dangerously unchecked power in Batman&apos;s growling skepticism over Superman, but the preposterous resolution of that &ldqou;conflict&rdquo; showed that his chat had the substance of tracing paper.
He wasn&apos;t interested in taking part in that conversation, despite the flak that his justly-derided Man of Steel took for its shitstorm of destruction.
The eponymous butting of heads was merely a prelude.
To what? More destruction.

Luckily for 2016, though, the year&apos;s other major superhero battle royale is here to pick up that mantle.

Contrary to what the more gleefully fantastical Marvel movies would have you expect, *Captain America: Civil War* is here to sit down and talk about violence.
And on the table is not only a discussion of the collateral damage that these desensitising movies persistently ignore, but a somber and intelligent moral quandary side dish is being served, too.
In splitting each side of the argument between the whole team &ndash; with &ldquo;pragmatic man of science&rdquo; Tony Stark leading the charge against an ideological embodiment literally named Captain America &ndash; the movie vocalises every corner of the debate in a way that errs closer to constructive than destructive.

The most blatant exposure of Snyder&apos;s fundamental failure is the Russos&apos; insistence on fleshing out both sides of the issue.
Despite its primary colours and sitcom jokes, *Civil War* ultimately resists folding to an easy solution that tells you exactly what to think: As convincing as Stark&apos;s plea for accountability is, his &ldquo;red, white and blue&rdquo; compadre&apos;s skepticism of the mechanisms of politics is equally developed.
This pays off in the genuinely heartbreaking climax, where emotional stakes overturn any tangible ones and a surprising sense of unpredictability takes hold.
For a moment it seems as if the series has made a shockingly fatal commitment, and it&apos;s an exciting &ndash; if ultimately disingenuous &ndash; sensation for a franchise of this size.

And it due to this &ldquo;size&rdquo; &ndash; the unavoidable temporal advantage the extended Marvel universe has over its hastily-assembled DC counterpart &ndash; that these sentiments really register.
By this point, countless instalments in, we implicitly know these characters, so their ethical stances have precedent.
Every decision that Iron Man makes is completely true to his character, while the Cap&apos;s staunch defiance is the logical culmination of hours of groundwork.
*Batman V Superman* flopped dramatically because the icons of the title were shoehorned into perspectives that often lacked any logical build-up.
This flagging drama is finally put out of its misery by a ludicrous deus ex machina that flips the table over, betraying an utter disregard for just shutting up and thinking.
*Civil War* dedicates impressive time to piping down and exercising its mind, and it has the sophistication to feed it directly into the action.

> An opening gambit in Lagos takes *Bourne*&apos;s earthiness and dresses it in a cape to thrilling effect.

Which is another instance of the Russos hitting it out of the park where others have fumbled with the bat.
The rollercoaster peaks of *Civil War* may hit home harder because of their definition against the carnage previously wrought by the Avengers, but even taken on their own terms they&apos;re a mighty impressive spectacle.
An opening gambit in Lagos, for instance, takes *Bourne*&apos;s earthiness and dresses it in a cape to thrilling effect.
A freewheeling chase through the city later on melds the giddy multi-level gymnastics of the grand Avengers finale to *Winter Soldier*&apos;s surveillance state jitters, dragging you through a riveting carnival ride.
The much-lauded centrepiece, meanwhile, gets each side of the argument riled up enough to clobber at each other, bringing to life the balls-to-the-wall comic cells from which it&apos;s inspired.
It&apos;s a wonderful smorgasbord of different flavours and textures, and it&apos;s to the immense credit of the creative team that it holds together as seamlessly as it does.

Of course, it&apos;s never quite as satisfying as it could be were it an independent entity, what with its slavishness to its mythology and restlessness in setting up future adventures.
Its very raison-d&apos;&circ;trÃª-&#234; is its serialised roots, but this same dependency inevitably sells the high stakes short, resulting in this weird state of limbo where the rising drama is perpetually cut short.
We all know that nothing is going to happen to seriously rock the boat, yet, with every shocking plot twist, we yearn for it to commit to the grizzly end.
It&apos;s stuck between a rock and a hard place, and it&apos;s essentially by definition.

Even still, though, it&apos;s a tremendous piece of entertainment.
Scattershot and anti-cathartic as it may be, it has enough brains, brawn and crucial understanding of how to construct an exemplary blockbuster that it&apos;s worth a punt.
If the intertextual superhero genre is how Hollywood ends, then *Civil War* marks it as a bang instead of a whimper.
