<span class="firstline">Superman has always been a fella too powerful for his own good.</span>
Seeing the Kryptonian lift a car on the first issue of _Action Comics_
was no doubt met by 1938 audiences with a sense of awe and fear akin to that which met the Lumiere train
some 43 years earlier,
but sadly Clark Kent&apos;s feats of superhuman name-it against a backdrop of invulnerability
leave him by the wayside next to the flawed, human characters from the Silver Age.

> This right here is a blockquote, yo.

Spider-Man&apos;s teenage angst and comparatively comical powers make the character
much more relatable than his opposing mascot.
That DC Comics laughed Stan Lee out of their offices when he pitched Spider-Man is telling:
in DC-land, heroes are rich, righteous, almost royal figures with no room for humanity.
The renegade, the rogue, the doomed and the indecisive have no place in the DC universe,
where epic escapism is the raison d&apos;etre.

At this point, I&apos;d set you up with a chimpanzee if it&apos;d brought you back to the world! it&apos;s not the size mate,
It&apos;s how you use it.
Jasper: your baby is the miracle the whole world has been waiting for.
It&apos;s not the size mate, it&apos;s how you use it.
You know, your bobby dangler, giggle stick, your general-two-colonels, master of ceremonies.
Yeah, don&apos;t be shy, let&apos;s have a look.

My lord! you&apos;re a tripod.
Yes, I used a machine gun.

You&apos;re only supposed to blow the bloody doors off! pull my finger!
When I get back, remind to tell you about the time I took 100 nuns to nairobi!
You are as precious to me as you were to your own mother and father.
I swore to them that I would protect you, and I haven&apos;t.
