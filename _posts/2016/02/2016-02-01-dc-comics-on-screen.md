Superman has always been a fella too powerful for his own good.
Seeing the Kryptonian lift a car on the first issue of _Action Comics_
was no doubt met by 1938 audiences with a sense of awe and fear akin to that which met the Lumiere train
some 43 years earlier,
but sadly Clark Kent&apos;s feats of superhuman name-it against a backdrop of invulnerability
leave him by the wayside next to the flawed, human characters from the Silver Age.

Spider-Man&apos;s teenage angst and comparatively comical powers make the character
much more relatable than his opposing mascot.
That DC Comics laughed Stan Lee out of their offices when he pitched Spider-Man is telling:
in DC-land, heroes are rich, righteous, almost royal figures with no room for humanity.
The renegade, the rogue, the doomed and the indecisive have no place in the DC universe,
where epic escapism is the raison d&apos;Ãªtre.
